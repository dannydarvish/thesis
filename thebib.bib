Above 1 GeV the states form a conventional qqÌ nonet mixed with the glueball of lattice QCD. Below 1 GeV the states also form a nonet, as implied by the attractive forces of QCD, but of a more complicated nature. Near the centre they are (qq)3Ì(qÌqÌ)3 in S-wave, with some qqÌ in P-wave, but further out they rearrange as (qqÌ)1(qqÌ)1 and finally as mesonâmeson states. A simple effective chiral model for such a system with two scalar nonets can be made involving two coupled linear sigma models. One of these could be looked upon as the Higgs sector of nonpertubative QCD.}

We also compute the isospin current form factor in this model and compare our results with the known exact expressions for the S-matrix and the form factor in the continuum limit. As a technical improvement, we introduce a two-cluster simulation algorithm which leads to significantly reduced statistical errors in the calculation of four-point correlation functions."

abstract = {Lattice investigation of the scalar mesons a 0 (980) and $\kappa$ using four-quark operators Abstract: We carry out an exploratory study of the isospin one a 0 (980) and the isospin one-half $\kappa$ scalar mesons using N f = 2 + 1 + 1 Wilson twisted mass fermions at one lattice spacing. The valence strange quark is included as an Osterwalder-Seiler fermion with mass tuned so that the kaon mass matches the corresponding mass in the unitary N f = 2 + 1 + 1 theory. We investigate the internal structure of these mesons by using a basis of four-quark interpolating fields. We construct diquark-diquark and molecular-type interpolating fields and analyse the resulting correlation matrices keeping only connected contributions. For both channels, the low-lying spectrum is found to be consistent with two-particle scattering states. Therefore, our analysis shows no evidence for an additional state that can be interpreted as either a tetraquark or a tightly-bound molecular state.},

abstract = {We investigate the quark content of the low-lying states in the IJ P ﬁ º 10 ˛ ﬁ sector, which are the quantum numbers of the a 0 980ﬁ meson, using lattice QCD. To this end, we consider correlation functions of six different two-and four-quark interpolating fields. We evaluate all diagrams, including diagrams, where quarks propagate within a time slice, e.g. with closed quark loops. We demonstrate that diagrams containing such closed quark loops have a drastic effect on the final results and, thus, may not be neglected. Our analysis, which is carried out at unphysically heavy u and d quark mass corresponding to m $\pi$ º 2963ﬁ MeV and in a single spatial volume of extent 2.9 fm, shows that in addition to the expected spectrum of two-meson scattering states there is an additional energy level around the two-particle thresholds of K ˛ Ø K and $\eta$ ˛ $\pi$. This additional state, which is a candidate for the a 0 980ﬁ meson, couples to a quark-antiquark as well as to a diquark-antidiquark interpolating field, indicating that it is a superposition of an ordinary Ø qq and a tetraquark structure. The analysis is performed using AMIAS, a novel statistical method based on the sampling of all possible spectral decompositions of the considered correlation functions, as well as solving standard generalized eigenvalue problems.},

The recently developed stochastic LapH method has proven to be a valuable tool in lattice QCD calculations when all-to-all quark propagators are needed, as is the case for isoscalar mesons and two-hadron operators. This method is especially important for large volumes where other methods do not scale well. These calculations were done with 412 gauge configurations using clover-improved Wilson fermions on a large anisotropic 32? {$\times$} 256 lattice with a pion mass near 240 MeV. The stationary states determined to be single-particle dominated are compared with the experimental resonances and are found to be in reasonable agreement. Additionally, the initial development of tetraquark operators is described.}
