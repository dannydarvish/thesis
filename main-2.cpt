Overlap factors for the rotated $13\times 13$ correlator matrix in the $a_0(980)$ channel, using the same operator basis given in Table~\ref{table:a0_ops_no_tq}, with the addition of one tetraquark operator. Operators labeled by \verb+ROT N+ denote our variationally improved single-hadron operators.^^E^^L
