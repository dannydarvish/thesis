Overlap factors for the operators used in the rotated $12\times 12$ correlator matrix in the $a_0(980)$ channel, using the operators in Table~\ref{table:a0_ops_no_tq}, which contains no tetraquark operators. Operators labeled by \verb+ROT N+ denote our variationally improved single-hadron operators.^^E^^L
